Readme for git CV page
# CV-page

This small code project is meant to be used for an easy one-page layout CV-webpage. IT can easily be extended and uses bootstrap to ensure any display size.
The entire website is structured in different sections (Home, Skills, Experience, Accomplishments and Projects).


## Different Section Types
All sections are marked in the Html through a bigger comment section separating them. This sectioning is just a basic example and can always be adjusted to the person's needs.

- Home: 
This section includes the profile picture, some other Links (GitHub, LinkedIn or others), a biography text, interests and education.

- Skils:
This section includes all your skills, with small icons representing them.

- Experience:
The experience section shows a timeline of all the experiences. There should be all employments or key experience points included.

- Accomplishments:
This section includes all the accomplishments that needed to be highlighted, like, for example, certificates, publications or prizes you won.

- Projects:
This section includes all your projects with a filtering section to help focus on a specific category of the projects.


## Codebase 

The codebase includes pictures, js, CSS and Html for the website.

Most of the code is on a block base and can be duplicated to add information.


## File structure

The files are structured in basic folders to include the pictures and other files more ordered.
